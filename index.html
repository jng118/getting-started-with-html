<h1> Important Concepts from the Intro</h1>

<body> <b>Coding </b></body>
<br>
<p> <b>Coding</b> is telling a computer what you want it to do in its own language. </p>
<br>
<body> <b><p> The 5 ways of thinking like a computer programmer </b> </body></P>

<body> <b><p>1. Procedural Thinking</b>: is the process of taking problems and breaking it down into a series of steps to address the problem.</p>

<b><p>2. Abstract Thinking</b>: is the process of using logic to get to the core of an abstract problem, e.g. one apple plus one apple equals two apples.  The core logic behind it is 1+1 = 2, even though you are using apples to replace the numbers</p>

<b><p>3.  Systematic Debugging</b>: is the process of identifying problems and tracking it down to its cause to fix the problem</p>

<b><p>4.  Technological Empathy</b>: is understanding how the computer sees things</P>

<b><p>5.  Systems thinking</b>: thinking like a programmer and using the above steps to identify and fix the problem.</p>

<body><b>The "Interwebs"</b> </body>

<p> The internet is a collection of date. Namely, HTML documents that are contained on servers and accessed by myself or others using a web brower.  HTML documents are comprised of <em><b> text context</b></em>(what I see), <em><b> markup </em></b> (what it looks like), <em><b> references </b></em> (other documents like images and videos) and <em><b> links </b></em> (links to other pages).</p>
<br>
<body><b>HTML</b></body>

<b>HTML</b> stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>angauge</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<body> <b>Tags and Elements</b> </body>
<br>
<p>We use <b>tags</b> to define <b>elements</b> (or what makes up HTML code).  For example a tag such as < b > will define that you want the text to contain an element that is "bold".  Examples of tags are: < b > - bold, and < em > - italics.</p>
 <br> 
  <p><b>Inline and Blocks</b></p>
  <br>
  <body><b>Inline</b> objects are tags you use in line of code to tell the computer how you want that code to display, e.g. using < b > to show that you wanted text in bold.  <b>Blocks</b> are tags that you use to put just that, blocks around your text to create form and spacing.  You can also modify these blocks by defining its height and width.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <body><b> Attributes</b></body>
  <p>Attributes are properties of HTML elements.  For example, we can use the < href > tag to create an anchor which is basically a link to another document (page, image, etc.)
    An example of an < href > tag is this: <a href="www.yahoo.com"> Yahoo!</p></a>

    <body><b> Syntax<b/></body>
 <body>You must be careful to write code in a specific way or else the computer will not know what to do with it so that means you have to use tags to define your elements as well as close them to ensure that the computer is doing what you specifically want.  For example if I don't use the closing tag on what I want to make bold then the entire paragraph displays in bold.</body>
